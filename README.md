A  **credit risk**  is the risk of  [default](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_(finance) "Default (finance)")  on a debt that may arise from a borrower failing to make required payments.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_risk#cite_note-bcbs-1)  In the first resort, the risk is that of the lender and includes lost  [principal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_sum "Principal sum")  and  [interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest "Interest"), disruption to  [cash flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow "Cash flow"), and increased  [collection costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collection_cost "Collection cost"). The loss may be complete or partial. In an efficient market, higher levels of credit risk will be associated with higher borrowing costs. Because of this, measures of borrowing costs such as  [yield spreads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_spread "Yield spread")  can be used to infer credit risk levels based on assessments by market participants.

Losses can arise in a number of circumstances,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_risk#cite_note-2)  for example:

-   A consumer may fail to make a payment due on a  [mortgage loan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan "Mortgage loan"),  [credit card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card "Credit card"),  [line of credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_credit "Line of credit"), or other loan.
-   A  [company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company "Company")  is unable to repay asset-secured fixed or  [floating charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_charge "Floating charge")  debt.
-   A business or consumer does not pay a  [trade invoice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_credit "Trade credit")  when due.
-   A business does not pay an employee's earned  [wages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage "Wage")  when due.
-   A business or government  [bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance) "Bond (finance)")  issuer does not make a payment on a  [coupon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_(bond) "Coupon (bond)")  or principal payment when due.
-   An insolvent  [insurance company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_company "Insurance company")  does not pay a policy obligation.
-   An insolvent  [bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank "Bank")  won't return funds to a depositor.
-   A government grants  [bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy "Bankruptcy")  protection to an  [insolvent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency "Insolvency")  consumer or business.

To reduce the lender's credit risk, the lender may perform a  [credit check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_check "Credit check")  on the prospective borrower, may require the borrower to take out appropriate insurance, such as  [mortgage insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_insurance "Mortgage insurance"), or seek  [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance) "Security (finance)")  over some assets of the borrower or a  [guarantee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarantee "Guarantee")  from a third party. The lender can also take out insurance against the risk or on-sell the debt to another company. In general, the higher the risk, the higher will be the  [interest rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate "Interest rate")  that the debtor will be asked to pay on the debt. Credit risk mainly arises when borrowers are unable to pay due willingly or unwillingly.
